# Stroke Prediction Project

## Introduction
Stroke is a global health concern, recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This project aims to predict strokes using machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset provided by the WHO, including attributes such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

**Project Overview:**
The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that determines whether an individual is at risk of experiencing a stroke. This has implications for early intervention and personalized care plans, contributing to improved public health.
